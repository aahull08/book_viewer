## Roadmap
In the future I wish to allow this to use a SQL database so that it can have multiple books to read.
Also it would be great if you could click a word and get a definition to pop up on the screen.
Lastly, I would add a quiz at the end of each chapter that would allow teachers to assign a book and recieve scores for each student.
